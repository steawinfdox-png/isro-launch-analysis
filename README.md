# ISRO Launch Analysis: Data Visualization/Exploration
> Data analysis and visualization of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) launch data, exploring annual launch frequency, vehicle classification, mission applications, and launch orbital types from 1979-2023.

# How it works
ISRO Launch Analysis uses a Python script to analyze public mission data from ISRO. Access dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nihilisticneuralnet/every-isro-space-missions). This project includes a Python menu interface, Jupyter Notebook, CSV Dataset, that allows users to generate visual insights using ISRO's launch data in a highly interactive fashion.

# CONTENTS
- ISRO-Launch-Analysis.ipynb (Main notebook contianing EDA + visualizations)
- isro_missions(in).csv | (Cleaned dataset used for analysis)
- isro_analyzer.py (Partial cript with menu-driven activate() function for CLI execution)

# PROJECT GOALS:
* Compare ISRO missions by mission purpose
* Understand trends/changes in annual launch rates
* Identify most commonly chosen launch vehicles
* Provide an interactive Python interface for user-driven exploration with visualizations based on 4 categories
  
# VISUALIZATIONS INCLUDED:

1. Launches per year
2. Missions by application (Observation, communication, experimental, etc)
3. Launches by vehicle used
4. Missions by orbit type

# How to Run the Project on YOUR Device:

1. Clone Repository
2. Install requirements (pandas and matplotlib)
3. Open Jupyter Notebook
4. Run menu interface by running the cell containing "activate()" inside the notebook
5. Select from 5 available data visualizations
